        <h3>Moores Construction <i> to lead new metro project </i> from dublin airport to city centre</h3>
        <p>The Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan has secured agreement from Cabinet to move forward with the transformative MetroLink rail project.
          Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan brought the MetroLink Preliminary Business Case to Cabinet yesterday. 
          Planning submission on the public transport ‘megaproject’, which will transform public transport in Dublin and improve interconnectivity with national rail links, will be lodged this September. 
          It is anticipated that MetroLink could be in operation in the early 2030s.
          MetroLink is a transformative piece of new public transport infrastructure, the first of its kind in Ireland. 
          It will consist of a fully segregated railway, most of which will be underground, running from north of Swords to Charlemont in the south of Dublin City Centre. 
          The route will include 16 stations and serve multiple residential communities such as Swords, Ballymun and Glasnevin, as well as the City Centre, Dublin Airport, and major employment, education, transport and other centres.
        <p>When operations commence, there will be trains every 3 minutes during peak periods. This can rise to a service every 90 seconds by 2060 with the system capable of carrying up to 20,000 passengers per hour in each direction. For comparison, Luas Green Line can carry circa 9,000 passengers per direction per hour.
          A metro for Dublin has been in development in various forms for more than 2 decades. Ireland remains one of only a small number of countries in Europe without a metro in its biggest city or a rail connection to its main international airport. The National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2030 specifically lists MetroLink as one of its strategic investment priorities and it is fully aligned with the Climate Action Plan 2021 and other major strategic plans..</p>.</p>
          Following this decision, TII will submit a planning application for the MetroLink route to An Bord Pleanála in September, with the procurement process commencing next year. Dependent on the outcome of the planning and procurement processes, construction of MetroLink is earmarked to commence in 2025 with a view to operation in the early 2030s.

        <h3>Intel Project coming to an end</h3>
        <p>The Chief Executive of Intel has said that Ireland will have to compete for future investments by the company.Pat Gelsinger was speaking to RTÉ News at the official opening of a new manufacturing facility at Intel's plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare.
          'Fab 34' is part of a €17 billion investment which doubles Intel's manufacturing space in Ireland.
           When production is fully ramped up, the company will employ 6,500 people in Ireland.
           Work on the facility began in 2019 and it is the first high-volume manufacturing location for the production of Intel 4 products.</p>
        <p>The Taoiseach Leo Varadkar joined Mr Gelsinger at the company's Leixlip plant today for the official opening of 'Fab 34'.
           Asked about Ireland's corporate tax rate increasing next year, the Intel CEO said that they look at a variety of costs when running factories, including tax.
          "Obviously we have been in Ireland for over three decades and we love Ireland," Mr Gelsinger told RTÉ News.
          "At the same time we tell the Irish Government, you are going to have to compete for the next projects as well."
          "We want to keep building here and continue to expand but that is going to require Ireland to be competing to be able to win those next projects but we have such a great legacy here we think we'll figure it out," he added.
           Intel was not immune from the cuts impacting the tech sector over the last year, including at its Irish operation, where there have been around 130 redundancies and pay cuts for senior staff.</p>
        <p>Mr Gelsinger said the majority of Intel's restructuring has been completed.
          "Obviously, the economic cycle made that a little bit more challenging but I think we are now at the healthy thing, where we have to keep dieting, keep exercising but we feel really good about the expansion of our capacity, the new jobs and the new tech that is leading right here in Europe," he said.
           Intel said that the opening of the new 'Fab 34' in Ireland, combined with new planned facilities in Germany and Poland, will help create a first-of-its-kind end-to-end semiconductor manufacturing value chain in Europe.
           At today's launch, Intel also announced its Ireland Climate Action Plan, which details efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, water use and waste to landfill.
           The company said its new 'Fab 34' facility was designed for increased sustainability.
           Intel also announced today that it will donate €1 million to the Leixlip community to fund a community project.</p></p>
